=====================
This was the first program I wrote by myself. I used Python 3.4 I believe.
In order for this to run, you have to save the text files on your computer somewhere
and then go in and edit the file paths in the Main program to where you saved those
files. Then run the program and find out what color(s) you are. I will eventually
go in and edit the code so that it asks the person to set the file path, but 
probably not till winter break when I get some time to freshen up on my python.

I know there is a lot of text in the program, but it is a Test - a fun Test :)
