In childhood… 
 Of all types of children, I had the most difficult time fitting into academic routine. 

 I learned by doing and experiencing rather than by listening and reading.  

 I needed physical involvement in the learning process and was motivated by my own natural competitive nature and sense of fun.  



In relationships… 
 I seek a relationship with shared activities and interests.   

 I like to explore new ways to energize the relationship.   

 In a relationship, I need to be bold and thrive on physical contact.   

 I enjoy giving extravagant gifts that bring obvious pleasure to special people in my life.  



At work… 
 I am bored and restless with jobs that are routine and structured.   

 I am satisfied in careers that allow me independence and freedom, while utilizing my physical coordination and my love of tools.   

 I view any kind of tool as an extension of myself.   

 I am a natural performer.
